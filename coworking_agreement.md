# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*
Sophie needs Slack as a communication channel for successful work.
Nadia needs to know who will be responsible for which part of the work (to divide the tasks), the deadlines for them, and the ability to contact her partner during working hours via Slack or Zoom.

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*
We will divide work to do independently most of the time, but sometimes write code together, for example during co-working sessions or class meetings. We will share thoughts and updates about each part in Slack.

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*
Sophie learns best by reading instructions first; then she takes notes in Google Docs to organize her understanding and track what needs to be done. Nadia learns best by reading the README and studying the project structure to understand how the different modules are connected, and after that she writes the implementation on her own, later discussing unclear parts with her partner.


## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*
Via Slack and Zoom.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*
Nadia and Sophie want to improve their live coding skills.

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
